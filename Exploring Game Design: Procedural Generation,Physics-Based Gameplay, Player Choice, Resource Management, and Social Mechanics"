#Procedural generation:

procedural generation means the data or the content is generated via a certain logic/algorithm, instead of a human creating the content manually.
Procedural generation is put to use in a lot more complex ways like generating graphics for video games. The awesome unending open world games graphics, where there is literally no end to the world, are a result of the procedural generation technique.
GTA is a renowned example of this. The sole reason why the game exploded was that the players could do anything, go anywhere, fulfil their wildest fantasies, like jumping a cargo truck from a hill or landing a passenger plane on a fishing boat. It’s crazy, the game offers an unprecedented user experience.
Gamers love open world games, which literally have no end. Run, drive, trek as far as, as long as you can.
It won’t take a genius to figure out that such a massive amount of content cannot be generated manually. It would take years if not decades to launch a game like this.
Such games are only possible via procedural generation. The game code generates the environments on the fly as the player progresses through the game, providing an immersive user experience.

##Examples of such games:

1:Minecraft: This sandbox game generates a vast, open-world with infinite terrain, biomes, and caves using procedural generation techniques.
2:No Man's Sky: This space exploration game uses procedural generation to create a procedurally generated universe with over 18 quintillion planets, each with its own unique flora, fauna, and ecosystems.
3:Spelunky: This 2D platformer uses procedural generation to create randomized levels with traps, enemies, and treasures, making every playthrough a unique challenge.
4:Dwarf Fortress: This simulation game generates a procedurally generated world with civilizations, history, and geography, allowing players to build and manage their own fortress in a randomly generated world.
5:Hades: This action-roguelike game uses procedural generation to create randomized dungeons, enemies, and loot, making each playthrough unique.




#Physics Based Gameplay:

In physics based games, the gameplay mechanics involve, well, physics! As the player, you'll probably have to carry things, toss things, jump around, and more. Gamers love these games for their challenge and (usually) their realism.

##Examples of such games:

1:Human Fall Flat is a platforming game where you control a humanoid, blank-faced creature with poor control over its limbs. You'll need to do what you can with your flailing arms in order to solve puzzles and reach the end of the levels!
2:In Half-Life, you'll play as Gordon Freeman, a physicist who works at a research facility where a dimensional rift is opened and an alien invasion begins. You'll spend the game taking out the monsters and, eventually, entering the other dimension to stop the creature on the other side that's keeping the rift open.
3:Portal: This puzzle game uses physics-based mechanics to allow players to manipulate space and momentum using a "portal gun" to solve puzzles and progress through the game.
4:Kerbal Space Program: This simulation game simulates the physics of space travel, allowing players to build and launch their own rockets and spacecraft to explore the solar system.
5:Angry Birds: This mobile game uses physics-based mechanics to allow players to fling birds at structures to destroy them, with the trajectory of the bird's flight affected by gravity, wind, and other environmental factors.




#Player Choice and Branching Narrative:

Player choice and branching narratives involve giving players the ability to make decisions that affect the story or outcome of the game. 
Branching Narrative is a storyline structure in which plot interactions and events are non-linear and allow players the freedom to choose how the story progresses, allowing for countless possibilities for how conversations and interactions, and ultimately, the plot will be told. 
Mass Effect is one of the most famous examples, as branching narrative is one of the franchises core pillars.
It allows the player to build different relationships as Commander Shepard with the other characters in the universe, and different characters will react positively or negatively towards Sheperd's decisions, and characters can even live or die, depending on the player’s choices. But Mass Effect doesn’t have skill checks. It gives the player different dialogue options, and the player must choose what they feel is the best option, without knowing the outcome.    

##Examples of such games:

1:The Witcher series: This RPG allows players to make choices that affect the outcome of the story, with multiple endings based on the player's choices.
2:Life is Strange: This adventure game allows players to make choices that affect the story and alter the timeline, leading to multiple branching paths and endings.
3:Mass Effect series: This sci-fi RPG allows players to make choices that affect the story and alter the relationships between characters, leading to different story outcomes and character interactions.
4:Detroit: Become Human: This narrative-driven game allows players to make choices that affect the story and relationships between characters, leading to multiple branching paths and endings.
5:The Stanley Parable: This interactive storytelling game allows players to make choices that affect the narrative, with the story branching off into different paths depending on the player's decisions.




#Resource Management and economy system:

Resource management is about collecting, monitoring, and leveraging quantitative resources with incomplete information. Any game with complex resource management, that offers compelling choices, will involve imperfect decisions, leading to interesting strategy.
For example, your merge game may involve creating an empire of houses. This is how it could work: Players start their game with small houses that generate revenue over time, usually in the form of coins. They can use coins to buy more houses and merge them together to upgrade them.

##Examples of such games:

1:Civilization series: This turn-based strategy game involves managing resources, research, and diplomacy to build a civilization and achieve victory.
2:Stardew Valley: This farming simulation game involves managing resources, crops, animals, and relationships with NPCs to build a successful farm and community.
3:SimCity: This city-building simulation game involves managing resources, infrastructure, and services to build and manage a city and its economy.
4:Oxygen Not Included: This survival simulation game involves managing resources, infrastructure, and the needs of the colonists to build and manage a successful colony on a hostile alien planet.
5:Banished: This city-building simulation game involves managing resources, food, housing, and infrastructure to build and manage a small, isolated community.




#Social mechanics and multiplayer interactions:

In-game social interaction often takes on the forms of communication with other gamers, guild, and group play
Traditionally, deeper social mechanics have been linked to midcore games. But lately, these deeper social mechanics, like co-ops, guilds, and social live events, have started appearing in traditionally single-player genres, like casual puzzle games. In other words, we are seeing more and more mobile games adding spaces where people can interact with each other, no matter the genre of the game.
Players are looking for social interaction and a sense of “digital togetherness,” which has resulted in the popularity of social gaming and playing together with other people (→ communities). Even though casual gamers are not as competitive-minded as midcore players, they still enjoy light competitiveness, especially as a part of a team.
For example, guild mechanics have proven to be a significant retention feature. Guilds connect players and help them form communities where they can chat together and even make friends.
A multiplayer video game is a video game in which more than one person can play in the same game environment at the same time, either locally on the same computing system (couch co-op), on different computing systems via a local area network, or via a wide area network, most commonly the Internet (e.g. World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, DayZ). Multiplayer games usually require players to share a single game system or use networking technology to play together over a greater distance; players may compete against one or more human contestants, work cooperatively with a human partner to achieve a common goal, or supervise other players' activity. Due to multiplayer games allowing players to interact with other individuals, they provide an element of social communication absent from single-player games.

##Examples of such games:

1:World of Warcraft: This MMORPG involves players cooperating to complete quests and progress through the game, as well as competing in PvP battles.
2:Fortnite: This battle royale game involves players competing against each other in a free-for-all battle to be the last player standing.
3:Among Us: This multiplayer game involves players working together to identify and eliminate imposters on a spaceship, while also trying to avoid being caught as an imposter themselves.
4:Rocket League: This multiplayer game involves players competing against each other in a game of soccer, but with rocket-powered cars instead of human players.
5:Sea of Thieves: This multiplayer game involves players cooperating to sail a ship, hunt for treasure, and fight against other pirates on the high seas.
